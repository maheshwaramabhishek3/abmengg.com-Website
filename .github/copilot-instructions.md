# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This file provides guidance for using GitHub Copilot in this project.

## Purpose
- Help automate code suggestions, refactoring, and documentation.
- Assist with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the ABM Engineering Group website.

## Usage
- Use Copilot to generate code for new features (e.g., navigation bar, gallery, slideshow logic).
- Request Copilot to refactor or optimize existing code.
- Ask Copilot for help with troubleshooting errors or improving UI/UX.

## Project Structure
- Main file: `index.html` (contains all website logic and layout)
- Images and assets are stored in respective folders (e.g., `Photos ABMC`, `photos ABMS`, `3D Elevation Designing`, `Structural Designing`, `Images`)

## Best Practices
- Keep code modular and readable.
- Use semantic HTML and accessible design.
- Organize scripts and styles for maintainability.
- Validate Copilot suggestions before applying.

## Example Requests
- "Add a sticky navbar with breadcrumbs."
- "Show all gallery images grouped by section."
- "Fix slideshow rotation logic."
- "Update image paths for new folders."

## Troubleshooting
- If Copilot suggestions cause errors, check for syntax issues and validate file paths.
- Undo changes if needed and re-request with more specific instructions.
